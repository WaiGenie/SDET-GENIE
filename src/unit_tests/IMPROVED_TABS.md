## User Experience Benefits
1. **Clearer Information Hierarchy**: Users can quickly find the information they need

3. **More Comprehensive Data**: Additional statistics and details provide deeper insights
4. **Improved Debugging**: Raw data access for troubleshooting when needed
5. **Framework Awareness**: Clear indication of available automation frameworks
6. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of related information

## Technical Implementation
The improvements were implemented by enhancing the following functions in `src/ui/main_view.py`:
- `_render_results_tab()`
- `_render_actions_tab()`
- `_render_elements_tab()`
- `_render_details_tab()`
- `render_execution_results()` (tab labels)

The implementation leverages the comprehensive element tracking data captured by the `ElementTracker` class to provide rich, detailed information about browser interactions.
